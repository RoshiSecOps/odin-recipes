Odin Recipes Project

This project is to finalize the foundations HTML course as a capstone.
It will demonstrate basic HTML knowledge and functionality.
The idea is to build upon this project as I acquire more skills along the curriculum.
The first iteration will be a bare-bones html file with multiple pages and images, utilizing all learned tags and html objects.
